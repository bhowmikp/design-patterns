# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns:
- They all encapsulate knowledge about what concrete classes the system uses.
- They hide how instances of thses classes are created and put together.

Creational patterns provides a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when.
