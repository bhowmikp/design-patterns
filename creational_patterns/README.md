# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns:
- They all encapsulate knowledge about what concrete classes the system uses.
- They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.

Creational patterns provides a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when.

- **Abstract Factory** - Creates an instance of several families of classes.
- **Builder** - Separates object construction from its representation.
- **Factory Method** - Creates an instance of several derived classes.
- **Prototype** - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
- **Singleton** - A class of which only a single instance can exist.
