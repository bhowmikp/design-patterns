# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

Structural Design Patterns are design patterns that ease the design by indentifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

- **Adapter** - Match interfaces of different classes.
- **Bridge** - Seperates an object's interface from its implementation.
- **Composite** - A tree structure of simple and composite objects.
- **Decorator** - Add responsibilites to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** - A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
- **Flyweight** - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
- **Proxy** - An object representing another object.
