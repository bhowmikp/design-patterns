## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patters are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the pattern of communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time.

Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

- **Chain of Responsibility** - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
- **Command** - Encapsulate a command request as an object.
- **Interpreter** - A way to include language elements in a program.
- **Iterator** - Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
- **Mediator** - Defines simplified communication between classes.
- **Memento** - Capture and restore an object's internal state.
- **Null Object** - Designed to act as a default value of an object.
- **Observer** - A way of notifying changes to a number of classes.
- **State** - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
- **Strategy** - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
- **Template Method** - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.
- **Visitor** - Defines a new operation to a class without change.
